The file bosworth_stone_all_data_for_osf_20210208.csv contains eye-tracking
and AOI data for all 61 valid participants and used for statistical analysis. 
The data is processed based on raw Tobii x/y coordinate data (described in 
Bosworth & Stone, 2021). Participants and trials that were removed from analysis
due to poor gaze data or miscalibration are not included in this dataset. 

## CSV fields ##
participant: unique identifier assigned to each participant
language: nonsigning/signing
gender: f/m
age: in years
age_group: infant/child
group: we counterbalanced the order of stimuli presentation in group 1 & 2
story: unique identifier assigned to each video clip
story_secs: length of video clip
direction: whether clip was played normally (forward) or in reverse
trial: trial order
repetition: whether it was the 1st or 2nd time the story clip was shown
aoi: area of interest label 
aoi_hits: count of frames where gaze was directed towards an area within the AOI
aoi_secs: aoi_hits converted into seconds
percent_of_story: percentage looking time at the specific AOI during the story
